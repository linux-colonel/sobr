# All configuration variables go here.
# This first section contains the basic variables.
# These are required.
# The variable $CONFIG may be referenced to specify the path to the local SOBR configuration directory.

#***************REQUIRED VARIABLES*******************

# The IP or hostname of the remote server
REMOTE_SERVER=

# The port on the REMOTE_SERVER on which sshd is running
SSHD_PORT=

# The remote user that the local account is authorized to connect to.
SSH_USER=

# The path to the ssh private key whose public key is installed on the remote
# server in the home directory of SSH_USER
SSH_IDENTITY=

# The path to the truecrypt volume that contains the backed up files on $REMOTE_SERVER.
# This file must be writeable by $SSH_USER.
REMOTE_VOLUME_PATH=

# This is the keyfile for the REMOTE_VOLUME_PATH.
# It must be kept on the LOCAL machine.  DO NOT upload it to REMOTE_SERVER unless you want to defeat the point of the encryption.
# It must NOT be readable by group or others.  The script checks this.
# It should be a small file with random contents.
# One way to generate it is $ dd if=/dev/urandom of=keyfile bs=1024 count=10 
SECRET_FILE=

# A file containing a list of paths (one per line) to back up from the LOCAL machine.
# These paths are relative to / by default.  To change this, change the BASEDIR variable below.
# The paths may include both files and folders.
# Do not escape paths with special characters or spaces. 
FILE_LIST=

#******* Advanced variables *******************
# If these are left blank, the indicated defaults are used.

# The mount point for the truecrypt volume to be mounted on the LOCAL_MACHINE
# The default is /mnt/sobr-fs
LOCAL_MOUNTPOINT=

# The folder in LOCAL_MOUNTPOINT to put the  backed up files in.
# The default is 'backup'
BACKUP_FOLDER=

# Thei local mountpoint for the remote sshfs containing the truecrypt volume.
# The default is /mnt/sobr-ssh-fs
LOCAL_SSH_MOUNTPOINT=

# The path that the paths in FILE_LIST are relative to (on the LOCAL machine).
# The default is / .
# This variable must end with / (or you must prepend everything in FILE_LIST with a /).
